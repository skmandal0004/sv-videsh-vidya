        The Duolingo English Test (DET) is an online English proficiency exam that has gained recognition by 
        several universities in India as an alternative to traditional English proficiency tests like TOEFL 
        and IELTS. The test measures a student's proficiency in reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. 
        One of the advantages of the DET is that it is flexible and can be taken online from the comfort of the 
        student's home. Another advantage is that it provides quick results, typically within 48 hours, which 
        makes it an ideal choice for students who need to meet strict admission deadlines.

        To prepare for the DET, students can use the Duolingo language learning app itself, as it provides a 
        comprehensive study program that can help develop proficiency in English. Additionally, students can 
        supplement their preparation by reading books, watching English language movies and TV shows, and 
        engaging in conversation with native speakers. To improve their speaking skills, students can practice 
        speaking in English with their friends or take part in language exchange programs.

        It is also essential for students to familiarize themselves with the format of the DET exam and practice 
        with sample questions. The Duolingo website provides free sample tests that students can take to get an 
        idea of the exam's structure and types of questions. Regular practice can help improve their time management 
        skills, accuracy, and confidence.

        gain admission to universities abroad, and students can prepare for it by using the Duolingo app, practicing
