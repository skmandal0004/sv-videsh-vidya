        particularly in the western hemisphere. Therefore, it is crucial for students aspiring to study abroad

        In addition to academic pursuits, strong spoken English skills can also enhance the student's ability to 
        interact with the local community and engage in cultural activities while studying abroad. Improving spoken 
        English proficiency can also boost the student's confidence, which can positively impact their academic 
        and professional pursuits.

        Moreover, a good command of English is also essential for pursuing career opportunities in the international 
        job market, where English is often the primary language of communication. Thus, having a good command of spoken 
        English is essential for students aspiring to study abroad, as it can help them excel academically, socially,
