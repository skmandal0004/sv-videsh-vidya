                Needless to say this is one of the most critical aspects of your
                Study Abroad application. We help our registered students in
                shortlisting the colleges/universities based on the Profile
                Assessment done in the first step. It involves interest of the
                students keeping in mind their overall profile which includes
                academic scores, standardized test scores, work experience,
                budget, and other factors. We are flexible in applying to
                universities where we are partnered and/or outside of that. Once
                the student is ready to apply after having consulted with
                friends and family, we start the Documentation. There are over
                10000+ courses in more than 15 countries across various fields
                to choose from.
